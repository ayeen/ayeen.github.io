    <p>
      Geun Young Yun is a building scientist working in the area of the design, operation, and evaluation of sustainable buildings. He is associate professor at Department of Architectural Engineering of Kyung Hee University, Korea. He obtained his BEng and MEng degrees from Chung Ang University. His MEng work developed a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program for the evaluation of indoor thermal environment. He then worked as an environmental consultant for sustainable building design in both Korea and UK. His technical skills and insights into “Environmental Design in Architecture” were matured during his MPhil study at the University of Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His PhD work at Cambridge University is a critical, new component of developing the understanding of the energy and environmental performance of building with respect to the role of human agency, obtained from a combined approach to field measurement and statistical simulation. He has published a series of academic papers for international referred journals in the field of human comfort, building controls and energy performance with regard to thermal and visual environments in and around buildings.
