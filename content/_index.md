        The Human Behaviour and Energy Laboratory (HuBEL) at the Kyung Hee University was founded in 2010. A central aim of the HuBEL is to contribute to creating carbon efficient and healthy buildings and cities by carrying out innovative research in the area of adaptive comfort, occupant behaviour, energy efficient control algorithm, building energy management system, deep neural network models, the energy-efficiency and renewable energy potentials of buildings and urban space, the health performance of buildings, urban climatic maps, and implications of climate change.

        Human factors in building performance is a key research area of HuBEL. The HuBEL has developed and adaptive comfort and behavioural models of control systems for thermal and luminous environments through the rigorous statistical analysis of field measurement data. The energy efficient control algorithms, which enable the application of the behavioural models to Building Energy Management System (BEMS), have been created and tested. The recent research of the HuBEL includes the development of real-time simulation with BEMS, the use of machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning) for the design and operation of buildings at urban scales.

        Another key research area is the visual perception of occupants and the application of advanced lighting systems. The HuBEL has investigated the visual effects of different spectral power distributions of light sources, the use of lighting systems in practice, and their energy implications through a series of experiments, field measurements, and simulations. Recently, the HuBEL has been testing the subjective responses of people to organic lighting emitting device (OLED) lighting and been developing the lighting strategies to apply OLED in buildings in a carbon efficient way, which can maximise the comfort and well-being of building occupants.
